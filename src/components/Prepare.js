          <h2>What is an Earthquake?</h2>
        <p>
          An earthquake is a sudden rapid shaking of the ground caused by the
          shifting of rocks deep underneath the earth’s surface. Earthquakes can
          happen without warning and can result in injuries and damage to
          property and roads. Earthquakes can cause fires tsunamis landslides or
          avalanches. While they can happen anywhere areas at higher risk for
          earthquakes include California Oregon Washington Alaska Hawaii Puerto
          Rico and the Mississippi Valley.
        </p>
        <h2>What to do in an Earthquake</h2>
        <p>If an earthquake happens protect yourself right away! </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you are in a car pull over and stop. Set your parking brake.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are in bed turn face down and cover your head and neck with a
            pillow.
          </li>
          <li>If you are outdoors stay outdoors away from buildings.</li>
          <li>Do not get in a doorway.</li>
          <li>Do not run outside.</li>
        </ul>

          />
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Drop: </strong>Wherever you are drop down on to your hands and
          knees. If you’re using a wheelchair or walker with a seat make sure
          your wheels are locked and remain seated until the shaking stops.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cover: </strong>Cover your head and neck with your arms. If a
          sturdy table or desk is nearby crawl underneath it for shelter. If no
          shelter is nearby crawl next to an interior wall (away from windows).
          Crawl only if you can reach better cover without going through an area
          with more debris. Stay on your knees or bent over to protect vital
          organs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hold on:</strong> If you are under a table or desk hold on
          with one hand and be ready to move with it if it moves. If seated and
          unable to drop to the floor bend forward cover your head with your
          arms and hold on to your neck with both hands.
        </p>
        <h2>Prepare Before an Earthquake</h2>
        <p>The best time to prepare for any disaster is before it happens.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Practice <strong>Drop Cover and Hold On</strong> with family and
            coworkers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Secure heavy items in your home like bookcases refrigerators
            televisions and objects that hang on walls. Store heavy and
            breakable objects on low shelves.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a <a href="/plan">family emergency communications plan</a>{" "}
            that has an out-of-state contact. Plan where to meet if you get
            separated.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="/kit">Make a supply kit</a> that includes enough food and
            water for at least three days a flashlight a fire extinguisher and a
            whistle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consider obtaining an{" "}
            <a href="/financial-preparedness">earthquake insurance policy</a>. A
            standard homeowner’s insurance policy does not cover earthquake
            damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consider making improvements to your building to fix structural
            issues that could cause your building to collapse during an
            earthquake.
            <br />
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Stay Safe After an Earthquake</h3>
        <p>
          If an earthquake has just happened there can be serious hazards such
          as damage to the building leaking gas and water lines or downed power
          lines.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Expect aftershocks to follow the main shock of an earthquake.</li>
          <li>
            Check yourself to see if you are hurt and help others if you have
            training.{" "}
            <a href="https://community.fema.gov/until-help-arrives">
              Learn how to be the help until help arrives
            </a>
            .
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are in a damaged building go outside and quickly move away
            from the building. Do not enter damaged buildings.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are trapped protect your mouth nose and eyes from dust. Send
            a text bang on a pipe or wall or use a whistle instead of shouting
            to help rescuers locate you.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are in an area that may experience tsunamis go inland or to
            higher ground immediately after the shaking stops.
          </li>
          <li>Text messages may be more reliable than phone calls.</li>
          <li>
            Once you are safe listen to local news reports for emergency
            information and instructions via battery-operated radio TV social
            media or from cell phone text alerts.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Be careful during post-disaster cleanup of buildings and around
            debris. Do not attempt to remove heavy debris by yourself. Wear
            protective clothing including a long-sleeved shirt long pants work
            gloves and sturdy thick-soled shoes during cleanup.
